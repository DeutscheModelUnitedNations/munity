# Frontend development

## Startup Page

The MUNity frontend uses Blazor Server side.

The first page that references all JavaScript and Stylesheets is the _Host.cshtml

it can be found inside ```src/MUNityCore/Pages/_Host.cshtml```

## Home Page (Index)

The first content page that is loaded is the Index.razor that can also be found under: ```src/MUNityCore/Pages/Index.razor```.

## Page oganisation

Everything is made into Components, so you can find all Pages and Components inside the __src/MUNityCore/Components__.

The parts are sorted into folders by the topic they cover for example: Simulations, List of Speakers, Resolutions etc.
